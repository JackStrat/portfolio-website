            <h3>Process Steps</h3>
            <p>
              Firstly, a set of brand guidelines was created based on a partially given design brief. Consolidated into a brand guidelines document with an accompanying client proposal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, user flows were created from user stories, to map the path taken by a prototypical user to complete a task.
            </p>
            <p>
              These flows were transformed into low, mid to high-fidelity wireframes of key screen layouts before testing on users to discover potential pain points.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user testing results led to improvements and iterations for the final designs.

              User flows were created from user stories and key functionalities, to map the path taken by a prototypical user to complete a task.

            <p>
              User flows were translated to a diagram to figure out the flow of the app after having thought about the customer experience and user needs. To best understand the needs and the experience of the user, it was important to map and
              visualize them.

            <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Low fidelity wireframes were created from the user flows and diagram, enabling to have the bare-bones elements that were to be included in the finished project. Sketches were relatively detailed to help with content creation further
              down the line.

            <h3>Mid Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Medium fidelity wireframes were created for user flow 3 as a step up from low fidelity, with more detail including accurate spacing, headlines, and buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
              These mid-fidelity wireframes were transformed into a prototype in preparation for the next stage in the process, a scenario based user test.</p>

            <h3>High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              After conducting the scenario based user test, compiling and analysing research notes, all designs were revised and pain points resolved. Producing a set of high fidelity wireframes, including typography, illustrations, icons, and CTA
              buttons.
            </p>
            <p>Colour was addressed and applied later in the final User Interface design screens, referencing the Brand guidelines meticulously.</p>

            <h3>Responsive Web App Designs</h3>
            <p>
              Responsive web app screens were designed to accommodate different screen sizes, so that the content looks great on any screen size.</p>
            <p>
              The following responsive web designs were created using the “mobile-first” principle, whereby the experience was defined first on mobile and then scaled up to larger screens (also known as “breakpoints”) such as a tablet, desktop, and
              desktop HD.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The mission was to create a product for every individual to save money, in a transparent and simplistic way in preparation for a big purchase or expenditure.</p>

        <p>The unique selling point that the community can choose to help charities as they save, builds trust and confidence in the company.</p>

        <p>Personality is reflected through the colour palette, white for clarity and predominantly deep blues communicating a feeling of professionalism and reliability.
          This can also be said for the illustrative style, as well as giving a friendly and human touch to the brand.</p>

        <p>It’s understood that saving can tend to be complicated, to counteract this feeling, the typographic set is contemporary, approachable and clear to read.</p>

        <p>The users don’t need to be a financial expert to save, that’s why it was kept simple.</p>

        <p>Every little goes a long way. </p>
        <p>Reach your goals, help others reach theirs.
